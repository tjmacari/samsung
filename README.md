# Samsung Smart TV experiment
Simple carousel built in ReactJS/Webpack which allows the user to scroll through Star Wars movies, built for Samsung TVs.  Tested using Tizen Studio Web Simluator Application (Samsung TV).

This web application uses Webpack, so the deployed code resides in the /dist folder.  In Tizen Studio, simply create an empty Samsung TV project and use the deployed files in the /dist folder.

To run the code in a local web server:
> npm install (the dependencies in package.json will be download)
> npm run start (will start the web application at localhost:8080)
In your browser, navigate to localhost:8080 to view the web application

To use the web application:
Simply use the Left/Right arrows on your Tizen Studio Web Simulator Application remote control, or your keyboard to scroll through the movies.
